# Define Inheritance it's types and how it works and example of it
## Defination
Inheritance is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).
## Types
1. Single Inheritance
2. Multilevel Inheritance
3. Hierarchical Inheritance
4. Multiple Inheritance
5. Hybrid Inheritance
## How it works
Inheritance is a mechanism wherein a new class is derived from an existing class. In Java, classes may inherit or acquire the properties (variables and methods) and behaviors from its predecessors or parent class. In other words, A subclass inherits the characteristics (properties and methods) of its superclass (ancestor). Let us dig in deeper to get insights into Inheritance in Java.
## Example
```java
class Animal{
    void eat(){System.out.println("eating...");}
}
